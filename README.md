I spend way too much fuggin time playing chess so now I need to do something useful with it

### Possible Ideas
- Chess bot (simulator) : For every position on the board simulate the game and determine the best move (chess.com must do this because Zac discovered there is an inconsistency in what is denoted as a bluNDER)
- Analyze chess data or something (what's the best opening move??) 
- Quantify what defines a good middle game 
- Idk open to thoughts

- HI ZAC
